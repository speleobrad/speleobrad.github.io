I'm starting a new blog, this time about my caving, cave diving and electronic experiments with build the network of water probes for measuring if water is good for diving. 

I chose [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), partly because I'm familiar with it from my previous blog, part because its really simple and straightforward. 

I always liked [Minimal mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) and decided I'd give it another go, adding some more stuff as I progress with the blog. 

I'm not good with fancy eye-catching photos, so I decided to use library from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com), whenever I don't have anything of my own. You'll notice the difference ;)

Hope you enjoy ;)

I'm starting a new blog, this time about my caving, cave diving and electronic experiments with build the network of water probes for measuing if water is good for diving. 

I chose Jekyll, partly because I'm familiar with it from my previous blog, part because its really simple and straitforward. 

I always liked Minimal mistakes theme and decided I'd give it another go, adding some more stuff as I progress with the blog. 

Hope you enjoy ;)
